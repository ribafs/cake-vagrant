No plugin ribafs/admin-br eu usei no post-upload-dump, que apenas executa o composer.json:

    "scripts": {
      "post-autoload-dump": "php copiar.php"
} 

Este é o arquivo copiar.php:

<?php
    copy ( 'copiar/AppController.php' , '../../../src/Controller/AppController.php');
    copy ( 'copiar/bootstrap_cli.php' , '../../../config/bootstrap_cli.php');
?>
